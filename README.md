# Small Python Projects

This repository contains a collection of small Python projects that demonstrate basic programming concepts, problem-solving, and interactive features. Each project is self-contained and focuses on specific functionalities, providing a fun and engaging way to explore Python programming.

## Projects

### 1. Slot Machine Simulation
A simple slot machine game where users can:
- Deposit funds.
- Bet on up to 3 lines.
- Spin the slot machine and win or lose based on matching symbols.

#### Features:
- Randomized slot machine spins with symbol frequency logic.
- Dynamic calculation of winnings based on bet amount and matched symbols.
- User-friendly prompts and error handling.

#### Key Concepts:
- Loops and conditionals.
- Data structures (lists and dictionaries).
- Randomization using the `random` module.

---

### 2. Arithmetic Operations Program
An interactive program that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and remainder) based on user input.

#### Features:
- Accepts two numeric inputs from the user.
- Performs all arithmetic operations on the inputs when prompted.
- Displays results in a readable format.

#### Key Concepts:
- User input handling.
- Arithmetic operators.
- Function definitions.

### 3. Dice Simulator
A dice rolling simulator that:
- Randomly generates numbers between 1 and 6.
- Displays visual representations of dice faces.
- Allows users to roll again or exit the program.

#### Features:
- Realistic dice rolls using the `random.randint` method.
- Visual output of dice faces using text-based graphics.
- Interactive interface for repeated rolls.

#### Key Concepts:
- Random number generation.
- Loops for continuous interaction.
- Conditional statements for visual output.

### 4. Digital Clock
A live digital clock application built using the `tkinter` library.

#### Features:
- Displays the current time in hours, minutes, and seconds.
- Updates every second for real-time accuracy.
- Graphical interface with a modern digital clock design.

#### Key Concepts:
- GUI development with `tkinter`.
- Real-time updates using `after()` method.
- String formatting for time representation.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
3. Navigate to the desired project directory.
4. Run the respective Python script (`.py`) using `python <filename>.py`.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- `tkinter` (pre-installed with Python standard library).

## Future Enhancements
